   the full GstTagList to the application

 o Made the internal test player a bit more usable

 o A number of fixes around automatic loading of external subtitles files

clutter-gst 1.3.14 (31/08/2011)
===============================================================================

List of changes since 1.3.12

  o Big split between the logic around playbin2 and the clutter-specific part
    to be able to reuse the GStreamer logic to implement new ClutterMedia
    objects.

  o Add new API to get the list of audio and subtitles tracks

  o Fix the leak of GstBus in VideoTexture

  o Fix the key navigation events in the sink

  o Some warning fixes with newer versions of Clutter

clutter-gst 1.3.10 (09/05/2011)
===============================================================================

List of changes since 1.3.8:

  o Fix the GstNavigation interface of the sink

Many thanks to:

    Bastien Nocera

clutter-gst 1.3.8 (05/04/2011)
===============================================================================

List of changes since 1.3.6:

  o Implementation of the GstNavigation interface in the sink,

  o Initial support of download buffering (opt in),

  o Series of cleanups in VideoTexture (subtitles reset when changing URI,
    state management, seek behaviour, ...)

  o The audio volume suffered from an hilariously bad bug that multiplied
    the volume set by 10. Took the opportunity to use GStreamer's
    StreamVolume to expose a cubic volume,

  o Compilation fixes for Windows.

clutter-gst 1.3.6 (02/03/2011)
===============================================================================

  * list of changes since 1.3.4

    o Make looping possible with set_playing(TRUE) in the the EOS callback

    o set_uri(NULL) is now handled and defined to stop the pipeline and set
      the video texture in "idle mode" (painted with the idle material)

clutter-gst 1.3.4 (10/01/2011)
===============================================================================

  * list of changes since 1.3.2

    o An API addition: set_seek_flags() on the VideoTexture for a finer control
      on how you can seek (fast or accurate),

    o Fix the notification of "progress" so it does not advertise 0 when
      seeking,

    o Fix the AYUV to RGBA shader.

clutter-gst 1.3.2 (20/09/2010)
===============================================================================

  * list of changes since 1.2.0

    o Respects the pixel-aspect-ratio property of the video frames and have
      VideoTexture advertise the right preferred size.

    o Reworked how ARB fp programs are set on the materials using a clutter 1.4
      feature to set a program on a material, fixing the way materials were
      used along the way.

    o Removed all raw GL code and only use Cogl.

Many thanks to:

  Robert Bragg

clutter-gst 1.2.0 (18/08/2010)
===============================================================================

  * list of changes since 1.0.0

    o Supports the ClutterMedia subtitle-related properties introduced in
      1.2.0.

    o Added a "idle material" to VideoTexture, a material that will be used
      to paint the texture when not playing any video.

    o You can now set a user-agent when streaming videos.

    o The usual bulk of small fixes, small memory leaks, build (builds on
      GLES2 now), don't use deprecated symbols, ...

    o Autoloads subtitle files when they have the same name than the video
      being played and are in the same directory.

    o GObject introspection support.

    o Added a new clutter_gst_init_with_arg() symbol, changed *get_playbin()
      to a more generic *get_pipeline()

    o A lot of small bug fixes and code clean up.

    o Added support for ARB fp 1.0 shaders when available.

    o Added support for YUV I420 to RBG colorspacing.

    o Removed the 'use-shaders' property on ClutterGstVideoSink. The sink

      negotiates capabilities based on what it has found.
